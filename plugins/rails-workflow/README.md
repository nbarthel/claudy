# Rails Workflow Plugin v2.0

A comprehensive Rails development plugin inspired by [claude-on-rails](https://github.com/obie/claude-on-rails) that orchestrates specialized AI agents to build full-stack Rails features. Unlike claude-on-rails which uses the claude-swarm gem, this plugin uses native Claude Code agent capabilities.

## Version 2.0 - Enhanced Edition ✨

**What's New:**
- ✨ **6 Auto-Invoking Skills** - Automatic quality enforcement (conventions, security, performance, testing)
- 🔒 **3 Quality Gate Hooks** - Block bad code before it reaches git (pre-agent, post-agent, pre-commit)
- 🎯 **Enhanced Architect Agent** - 7 comprehensive examples, tool mastery patterns, success criteria
- 📚 **Best Practices Built-In** - Rails conventions, security patterns, performance optimization
- 🚀 **Zero Configuration** - Skills and hooks activate automatically

## Overview

This plugin provides a team of specialized Rails agents that work together like a real development team, **with automatic quality enforcement** through skills and hooks.

### Highly Recommended: Install with MCP Servers

**For significantly enhanced capabilities**, also install the MCP servers plugin:

```bash
/plugin install rails-mcp-servers@claudy
```

**What You Get with MCP Servers:**

🚀 **Verification Against Official Docs**

- Agents verify patterns against Rails 8 documentation before implementing
- Ensures latest syntax and best practices
- Reduces hallucination and outdated patterns

🎯 **Project Pattern Matching**

- Agents analyze your existing code to match your style
- Consistent naming conventions across generated code
- Matches your validation patterns, test structure, and service patterns

⚡ **Enhanced Intelligence**

- Real-time access to Rails 8, Turbo, Stimulus, and Hotwire docs
- Filesystem operations to read and understand existing code
- Pattern detection across your codebase

**Example: With vs Without MCP Servers**

**Without MCP servers:**

```
You: "Create a Post model"
Agent: Creates model using general Rails knowledge
```

**With MCP servers:**

```
You: "Create a Post model"
Agent:
1. Checks Rails 8 model patterns in official docs
2. Reads your existing User model to match validation style
3. Verifies association syntax against current Rails docs
4. Creates model matching your project's exact patterns
```

**All agents work fully without MCP servers** - they're an enhancement, not a requirement. But with MCP servers, you get:

- ✅ Rails 8 specific features (encrypts, normalizes, Solid Queue)
- ✅ Code matching your existing patterns
- ✅ Verified against official documentation
- ✅ Up-to-date syntax and conventions

See [rails-mcp-servers](../rails-mcp-servers/README.md) for installation details.

## Auto-Invoking Skills (v2.0) ✨

Skills automatically validate and improve code quality **without explicit invocation**. They run in the background, catching issues before they become problems.

### 6 Skills Included

| Skill | Auto-invoke | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|
| **rails-conventions** | ✅ Always | Enforce naming, MVC separation, RESTful patterns | Catches plural model names, complex queries in controllers |
| **rails-security-patterns** | ✅ Always | Prevent SQL injection, validate strong parameters | Blocks string interpolation in SQL, missing params |
| **rails-performance-patterns** | ✅ Always | Detect N+1 queries, suggest indexes | Warns about missing eager loading |
| **rails-test-patterns** | ✅ Always | Ensure AAA pattern, enforce 80%+ coverage | Validates test structure and coverage |
| **rails-mcp-integration** | ⚙️ Manual | Query MCP servers for documentation | Use when uncertain about APIs |
| **agent-coordination-patterns** | ✅ Architect | Optimize multi-agent workflows | Parallel vs sequential decisions |

**How They Work:**

```
You write code → Skills validate automatically → You get instant feedback

Example:
1. Create model with plural name (Users)
2. rails-conventions skill detects: "❌ Model should be singular: User"
3. You fix it before committing
4. No bugs reach production
```

**Key Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Catches 90%+ common mistakes** automatically
- ⚡ **Instant feedback** (< 100ms per file)
- 🎯 **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- 📚 **Educational** - explains why and how to fix

**Configuration:**

Skills can be customized via `.rails-skills.yml`:

```yaml
skills:
  rails-conventions:
    enabled: true
    severity: error  # error, warning, info

  rails-security-patterns:
    enabled: true
    block_commit: true

  rails-performance-patterns:
    enabled: true
    n1_detection: true
```

## Quality Gate Hooks (v2.0) 🔒

Hooks run at key points in the workflow to ensure code quality and security.

### 3 Hooks Included

**1. pre-agent-invoke** (5 second timeout)
- **When**: Before any agent runs
- **Checks**: Rails project structure exists (Gemfile, app/, config/)
- **Purpose**: Prevent agents from running in wrong directory
- **Result**: ✅ Pass or ❌ Block agent

**2. post-agent-invoke** (30 second timeout)
- **When**: After agent completes
- **Checks**: Security issues, Rails conventions, test results
- **Purpose**: Validate agent output quality
- **Result**: ⚠️ Warnings (doesn't block)

**3. pre-commit** (60 second timeout)
- **When**: Before git commit
- **Checks**:
  - ❌ Blocks: Secrets, debuggers, SQL injection, missing strong params
  - ⚠️ Warns: Missing tests, complex queries
- **Purpose**: Prevent bad code from reaching git
- **Result**: ✅ Allow commit or ❌ Block commit

**Example Security Blocks:**

```bash
# Trying to commit code with debugger:
$ git commit -m "Add feature"
🔒 Running pre-commit security checks...
❌ Error: Debugger statements detected
app/controllers/users_controller.rb:15:    binding.pry
Remove debugging code before committing
```

**Skip Hooks (when needed):**

```bash
# Skip all hooks temporarily
SKIP_RAILS_HOOKS=1 bundle exec rails console

# Skip git pre-commit hook
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: debugging"
```

**Hook Configuration:**

Customize via `.rails-hooks.yml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre-agent-invoke:
    enabled: true
    checks: [rails_project, gemfile, app_directory]

  pre-commit:
    enabled: true
    block_on: [secrets, debuggers, sql_injection]
    warn_on: [missing_tests, style_violations]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with the Right Command

- Use `/rails-dev` for general requests
- Use `/rails-feature` for complete features
- Use `/rails-refactor` for code improvements

### 2. Be Specific

Good: "Create a Post model with title, body, and user association"
Better: "Create a blog Post model with title (string, 255 chars), body (text), published (boolean), belongs to User, has many Comments"

### 3. Trust the Architect

The architect agent understands Rails conventions and will make good decisions about:

- Database design
- RESTful routing
- Association configurations
- When to extract service objects

### 4. Iterate

You can refine features after initial generation:

```
1. /rails-feature User authentication
2. Review the implementation
3. /rails-refactor Add two-factor authentication
4. /rails-dev Add password complexity requirements
```

### 5. Let Agents Work in Parallel

The architect will run independent tasks in parallel for faster development.

## Rails Conventions Followed

This plugin enforces Rails best practices:

- **RESTful Design**: Standard REST actions and routing
- **Thin Controllers**: Business logic in models or services
- **Strong Parameters**: Mass assignment protection
- **Convention over Configuration**: Rails naming conventions
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Modern Rails**: Turbo, Stimulus, Hotwire patterns
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, XSS protection
- **Performance**: Eager loading, caching, indexes

## Requirements

- **Ruby**: 3.0+
- **Rails**: 7.0+
- **Claude Code**: Latest version
- **Project**: Must be a Rails application

## Troubleshooting

### Agents not found

Ensure agents and commands directories are in your project root or configured in Claude Code.

### Agent conflicts

If agents make conflicting changes, the architect will resolve them. You can also manually review and adjust.

### Missing dependencies

Some features require specific gems (Devise, Pundit, etc.). The agents will recommend installations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To improve this plugin:

1. Enhance agent prompts for better coordination
2. Add new specialized agents for specific domains
3. Improve error handling and edge cases
4. Add more example scenarios
