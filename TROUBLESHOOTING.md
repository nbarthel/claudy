# Troubleshooting Guide - Claude Hub Marketplace

## Issue: Only 2 Plugins Showing in Marketplace

If you're only seeing 2 out of 7 plugins when browsing the Claude Hub marketplace, try these troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Clear Claude Code Cache

Claude Code may be caching an old version of the marketplace configuration.

```bash
# Method 1: Restart Claude Code
# Close Claude Code completely and restart it

# Method 2: Clear plugin cache (if available)
# Check Claude Code settings for cache clearing options
```

### 2. Verify Marketplace Configuration

Ensure your Claude Code settings are pointing to the correct marketplace location:

```bash
# Check that Claude Code is configured to use this marketplace
# The marketplace URL should point to this repository's .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Expected marketplace configuration:**

- Repository URL: Your Claude Hub repository URL
- Marketplace file: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### 3. Verify Marketplace File

Check that the marketplace.json file is complete:

```bash
# Run the verification script
./scripts/verify-marketplace.sh

# Should show all 7 plugins:
# - rails-workflow
# - react-typescript-workflow
# - rails-code-review-agent
# - react-typescript-code-review-agent
# - ui-ux-design-agent
# - rails-dev-workflow
# - rails-mcp-servers
```

### 4. Check Plugin Metadata

All plugins now have complete metadata including:

- `author`: Plugin author information
- `homepage`: Link to plugin documentation
- `repository`: Source repository URL
- `license`: MIT license
- `category`: Plugin category (workflow, code-review, design, tools)
- `keywords`: Search keywords

You can verify this with:

```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
with open('.claude-plugin/marketplace.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    for plugin in data['plugins']:
        print(f"{plugin['name']}: category={plugin.get('category', 'MISSING')}")
EOF
```

### 5. Update to Latest Changes

If you cloned this repository before the recent updates, pull the latest changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Recent fixes:**

- Added complete metadata to all plugin entries in marketplace.json
- Added `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license` fields
- Added `category` field for better organization
- Updated verification script to handle namespace structure

### 6. Check Claude Code Version

Ensure you're using a recent version of Claude Code that supports:

- Plugin marketplaces
- Namespace structures (`./plugins/namespace/plugin-name`)
- MCP server plugins
- Full metadata fields

### 7. Manual Plugin Installation

If the marketplace is still not showing all plugins, you can install them manually:

```bash
# In your project directory
cd your-project

# Install a specific plugin manually
cp -r /path/to/claude-hub/plugins/claude-hub/rails-workflow .claude/
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Plugin not found" error

**Cause:** The source path in marketplace.json doesn't match the actual plugin location.

**Solution:** The source paths should be:

```json
"source": "./plugins/claude-hub/plugin-name"
```

### Issue: Plugins appear but can't be installed

**Cause:** Missing plugin.json manifest or invalid JSON.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Validate all plugin.json files
for plugin in plugins/claude-hub/*/; do
  echo "Checking $(basename $plugin)..."
  python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))" && echo "  âœ“ Valid"
done
```

### Issue: MCP server plugin not appearing

**Cause:** Claude Code version may not support MCP server-only plugins.

**Solution:** Ensure your Claude Code version supports MCP server configurations in plugins.

## Verification Checklist

Before reporting an issue, verify:

- [ ] All 7 plugins are listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- [ ] All plugin paths exist: `./plugins/claude-hub/*/`
- [ ] All plugins have `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifests
- [ ] Marketplace.json is valid JSON
- [ ] Claude Code is restarted after marketplace changes
- [ ] You're using the latest version of Claude Hub
- [ ] Your Claude Code version supports marketplaces

## Getting Help
