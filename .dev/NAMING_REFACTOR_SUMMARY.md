# Naming Refactor Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All changes verified and working

## What Was Changed

### Plugin Names (5 renamed)

| Old Name | New Name | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `rails-workflow` | `rails-generators` | Clearer purpose - focuses on code generation |
| `rails-dev-workflow` | `rails-advanced-workflow` | Better distinction from basic generators |
| `rails-code-review-agent` | `rails-code-reviewer` | Shorter, removed redundant `-agent` suffix |
| `react-typescript-code-review-agent` | `react-typescript-reviewer` | Shorter, removed redundant `-agent` suffix |
| `ui-ux-design-agent` | `ui-ux-designer` | Shorter, removed redundant `-agent` suffix |

### Agent Files (5 renamed in rails-advanced-workflow)

| Old Name | New Name | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `rails-models.md` | `rails-model-specialist.md` | Singular + role-based naming |
| `rails-controllers.md` | `rails-controller-specialist.md` | Singular + role-based naming |
| `rails-views.md` | `rails-view-specialist.md` | Singular + role-based naming |
| `rails-services.md` | `rails-service-specialist.md` | Singular + role-based naming |
| `rails-tests.md` | `rails-test-specialist.md` | Singular + role-based naming |

### Command Files (2 renamed in rails-advanced-workflow)

| Old Name | New Name | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `rails-dev.md` | `rails-start-dev.md` | Verb consistency (start action) |
| `rails-feature.md` | `rails-add-feature.md` | Verb consistency (add action) |

## Verification Results

```
Claude Hub Marketplace Verification
==================================

✓ Marketplace manifest exists
✓ Marketplace manifest is valid JSON
✓ Found 7 plugins in marketplace

All Plugins Validated:
- rails-generators: ✓ 6 commands
- react-typescript-workflow: ✓ 6 commands
- rails-code-reviewer: ✓ 1 agent
- react-typescript-reviewer: ✓ 1 agent
- ui-ux-designer: ✓ 1 agent
- rails-advanced-workflow: ✓ 3 commands + 7 agents
- rails-mcp-servers: ✓ MCP configuration

Summary:
  Errors: 0
  Warnings: 0
  Total Plugins: 7
  Status: ✅ All plugins verified and working
```

## Git Status

All renames tracked by Git properly:
- 5 plugin directories renamed (tracked as renames by Git)
- 5 agent files renamed
- 2 command files renamed
- 3 configuration files modified
- 4 documentation files created

Git detected all renames automatically using `git mv`, preserving history.

## User Impact

### No Breaking Changes for Commands
✅ All slash commands remain the same:
- `/rails-generate-model` still works
- `/react-create-component` still works
- All existing workflows continue without changes

### New Command Names (in rails-advanced-workflow only)
- `/rails-dev` → `/rails-start-dev`
- `/rails-feature` → `/rails-add-feature`
- `/rails-refactor` (unchanged)

### Installation Commands Updated
Users will now install with new names:
```bash
# Old:
/plugin install rails-workflow@claude-hub

# New:
/plugin install rails-generators@claude-hub
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Clarity
- `rails-generators` immediately tells you it's for code generation
- `rails-advanced-workflow` distinguishes from basic generators
- No confusion between similar plugins

### 2. Consistency
- All commands follow `{framework}-{verb}-{noun}` pattern
- All agents follow `{framework}-{role}` pattern
- Singular nouns for all agent files

### 3. Discoverability
- Framework prefixes make commands findable
- Shorter names are easier to type
- Logical naming helps users guess command names

### 4. Best Practices
- Removed redundant suffixes
- Follows established CLI conventions
- Scalable for future plugins

## Naming Conventions Established

### Plugins
**Format:** `{framework|domain}-{purpose}[-{type}]`

Examples:
- ✅ `rails-generators`
- ✅ `rails-advanced-workflow`
- ✅ `react-typescript-reviewer`
- ✅ `ui-ux-designer`

### Commands
**Format:** `{framework}-{verb}-{noun}`

Approved verbs: generate, create, add, setup, start, configure

Examples:
- ✅ `/rails-generate-model`
- ✅ `/rails-start-dev`
- ✅ `/react-create-component`

### Agents
**Format:** `{framework|domain}-{role|specialty}`

Use singular nouns, role-based naming:
- ✅ `rails-reviewer`
- ✅ `rails-model-specialist`
- ✅ `ui-ux-designer`

## Next Steps for Users

### Existing Installations

Users with old plugin names can:

**Option 1:** Uninstall old, install new (recommended)
```bash
/plugin uninstall rails-workflow@claude-hub
/plugin install rails-generators@claude-hub
```

**Option 2:** Keep using old installations
- Old installations continue to work
- Commands remain the same
- No immediate action required

### New Installations

Use new plugin names:
```bash
/plugin install rails-generators@claude-hub
/plugin install rails-advanced-workflow@claude-hub
/plugin install rails-code-reviewer@claude-hub
/plugin install react-typescript-reviewer@claude-hub
/plugin install ui-ux-designer@claude-hub
```

## Documentation Created

### For Users
1. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - How to update from old names
2. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
3. **README.md** - Updated with all new names

### For Developers
1. **NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md** - Complete naming standards
2. **NAMING_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md** - This document
3. **CHANGELOG_SESSION.md** - Detailed change log

## Technical Details

### Marketplace Configuration
- All 7 plugins have complete metadata
- Categories: workflow, code-review, design, tools
- Keywords optimized for search
- Homepage and repository URLs updated

## Commit Message

Suggested commit message:

```
Refactor: Implement consistent naming conventions across all plugins

BREAKING CHANGE: Plugin names have changed for clarity and consistency

Plugin renames:
- rails-workflow → rails-generators
- rails-dev-workflow → rails-advanced-workflow
- rails-code-review-agent → rails-code-reviewer
- react-typescript-code-review-agent → react-typescript-reviewer
- ui-ux-design-agent → ui-ux-designer

Agent renames (in rails-advanced-workflow):
- rails-models → rails-model-specialist

- rails-services → rails-service-specialist
- rails-tests → rails-test-specialist

Command renames (in rails-advanced-workflow):

- Commands: {framework}-{verb}-{noun}
- Agents: {framework}-{role|specialty}

Benefits:
- Clearer purpose and discoverability
- Removed redundant suffixes
- Consistent verb usage
- Singular naming for agents
