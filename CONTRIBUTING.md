# Contributing to Claude Hub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Claude Hub! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the plugin marketplace.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute:

1. **Create new plugins** - Add plugins for new frameworks or workflows
2. **Improve existing plugins** - Enhance commands or agents
3. **Fix bugs** - Report and fix issues
4. **Improve documentation** - Help others understand the plugins
5. **Share feedback** - Suggest improvements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Claude Code CLI
- Familiarity with markdown
- Understanding of the target framework/tool

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-hub.git
cd claude-hub
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Explore existing plugins:

```bash
./scripts/list-plugins.sh
```

## Creating a New Plugin

### Step 1: Plan Your Plugin

Before creating a plugin, consider:

- **Purpose**: What problem does it solve?
- **Scope**: Is it focused and well-defined?
- **Type**: Command-based, agent-based, or both?
- **Framework**: What technology does it support?

### Step 2: Create Plugin Structure

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/my-plugin/.claude/{commands,agents}
mkdir -p plugins/my-plugin/examples
```

### Step 3: Create package.json

```bash
cat > plugins/my-plugin/package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "@claude-hub/my-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Brief description of your plugin",
  "keywords": ["claude-code", "plugin", "your-framework"],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
EOF
```

### Step 4: Add Commands or Agents

#### For Commands

Create markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# command-name

Brief description of what this command does

---

Detailed instructions that Claude Code will execute when the command is invoked.

Include:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected behavior
- Error handling
- Example patterns
```

#### For Agents

Create markdown files in `.claude/agents/`:

```markdown
# agent-name

Brief description of the agent's purpose

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for the agent including:
- Primary responsibilities
- When to be invoked
- How to approach tasks
- What to prioritize

## Available Tools

List of tools the agent can use

## Examples

<example>
Context: Situation description
user: "User request"
assistant: "Agent response"
<commentary>Explanation</commentary>
</example>
```

### Step 5: Create README.md

Every plugin must have a comprehensive README:

```markdown
# Plugin Name

Description of the plugin

## Installation

Installation instructions

## Usage

How to use the plugin

## Features

List of features

## Requirements

Dependencies and requirements

## Examples

Usage examples

## License

MIT License
```

### Step 6: Add Examples

Create practical examples in the `examples/` directory showing real-world usage.

### Step 7: Validate Your Plugin

```bash
./scripts/validate-plugin.sh my-plugin
```

### Step 8: Test Your Plugin

1. Install to a test project:

```bash
./scripts/install-plugin.sh my-plugin /path/to/test/project
```

2. Test all commands/agents
3. Verify documentation accuracy
4. Check for edge cases
